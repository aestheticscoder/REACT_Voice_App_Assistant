# React Voice Recording Form

This is a React.js web application that allows users to record their voice and fill out a form. The application uses voice recognition to convert spoken words into text, which can be entered into the form fields. Once the user has entered all the required information, they can submit the form.

## Features

- Record and convert voice to text using the voice recognition feature.
- A simple form with fields for First Name, Last Name, State, District, Village, PAN Number, and Aadhaar Number.
- Basic error handling for required fields in the form.
- Submission of form data to a backend server (simulated).

## Installation

Before running the application, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

  
   git clone https://github.com/aestheticscoder/REACT_Voice_App_Assistant.git
 

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   
   cd voice-recording-form
  

3. Install the project dependencies:

   
   npm install
 

## Running the Application

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the application locally:


npm start


This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Fill out the form fields by speaking or manually typing the information.
- Click the "Start Recording" button to enable voice recognition.
- Click the "Stop Recording" button to stop the voice recognition and display the recognized text.
- Ensure that the required fields (e.g., First Name and State) are filled in.
- Click the "Submit" button to simulate form submission (adjust this part to your backend logic).

## Customization

You can customize the application further by modifying the CSS, adding more form fields, or integrating with your backend for real data storage.
